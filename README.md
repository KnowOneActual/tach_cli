# Tach CLI

Welcome to the Tach repository. This is a concept for a lightweight terminal application designed to keep time during live productions, events, and structured meetings. The goal is to build a distraction-free countdown timer and clock that helps you manage your pace without breaking focus.

Right now, Tach is entirely in the brainstorming stage. It is a personal project, so development might take some time to come to fruition. There is also a chance it remains just a concept and does not move forward, but I am exploring the idea and laying out the groundwork.

If you have any suggestions, feature ideas, or thoughts on how to make a tool like this better, I would love to hear them. Feel free to open an issue or share your thoughts. All ideas are welcome.
