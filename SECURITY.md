# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, contact the maintainer directly via your GitHub profile or email. You can find contact info on the [GitHub profile](https://github.com/KnowOneActual).

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to provide a fix or mitigation within 14 days depending on severity.
